# Hello-World
A dummy that thinks he is never to old to learn 
I think this is what I am ment to do ?
But I am not shure? Anyway if it wrong, I did what the tutorial said, But did not know which readme.md to click on as I had 2 readme.md's on screen, which did not help matters 
Anyway Hi My Name is John, and I have Been playing with IPFS, I have got the Daemon working and can see other peers, I have uploaded a mp3 file and can RAW play it back or run - localhost:5001 - or run - http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmdJqGKy8kXJDAk5WAay2zrrsAjY63K4ntuducxsNuT9bx 
and yes thats me playing a song that I wrote in 1972 - I uploaded the track with the r command line -
But I have not connected to anyone, I have showing that I am CONNECTED TO 312 PEERS, But can not find a Youtube tutorial video to show how link to someone and corrispond or get an answer back, If someone can piont me to a youtube for IPFS dummys that would be great.
