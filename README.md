# Hello-World
A dummy that thinks he is never to old to learn ?

I think this is what I am ment to do ?

But I am not shure? 

Anyway if it wrong, hay ho 

I did what the tutorial said, But did not know which readme.md to click on as I had 2 readme.md's on screen, which did not help matters 
Anyway Hi My Name is John, and I have Been playing with IPFS, I have got the Daemon working and can see other peers, I have uploaded a mp3 file and can RAW play it back or run - localhost:5001 - or run - http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmdJqGKy8kXJDAk5WAay2zrrsAjY63K4ntuducxsNuT9bx 
and yes thats me playing a song that I wrote in 1972 - I uploaded the track with the r command line -
But I have not connected to anyone, I have showing that I am CONNECTED TO 312 PEERS, But can not find a Youtube tutorial video to show how link to someone and corrispond or get an answer back, If someone can piont me to a youtube for IPFS dummys like me that would be great.
Almost forgot why I was here I have added IPFS Station to my google browser but it is not working I get --

Oh snap, it looks like your node is not running yet.
Please start it by running ipfs daemon on your terminal.
Also, please make sure you have CORS enabled, by running 
ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders '{"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": ["*"]}' - 

I have run the above but do not know what CORS is or how to implement it as I am no coder 

But it is still not working ? any help please.

UPDATE 30 OCTOBER 2017 
I now have IPFS Station working in chrome browser - But still have not P2P with anyone other than my own file - have still not learnt how to remove a file from IPFSlocalhost:5001/flies - there is a X with a delete next to it at the end of each file - but when X clicked the file is not removed - I added a video file via the drag and drop but it will not play when raw clicked But the mp3 file raw when clicked it plays - I will try the dos r command to upload a video - see you soon and let you know progress -
