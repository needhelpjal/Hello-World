Oh snap, it looks like your node is not running yet.
Please start it by running ipfs daemon on your terminal.
Also, please make sure you have CORS enabled, by running 
ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders '{"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": ["*"]}' - 

I have run the above but do not know what CORS is or how to implement it as I am no coder
